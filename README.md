# ApisRegularisedAutoencoders
repository for the Data Mining project for school

The sole purpose for this repository is to have an online repository to acces everything needed.

The raw data is not my property. For this project, we needed to use high dimensional data. So I chose following two papers:

SP: Tissue-specific transcriptional patterns underly seasonal phenotypes in honey bees. **Bresnahan et al.** -> https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.16220

TH: Transcriptional analysis reveals _Apis mellifera_ adaptations to high temperature and humidity. -> https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109599
